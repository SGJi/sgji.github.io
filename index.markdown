Dr. Shenggong Ji is currently a Researcher in [Interative Entertainment Group](https://ieg.tencent.com/), [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/zh-cn/). He got his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Southwest Jiaotong University, supervised by Prof. [Tianrui Li](http://userweb.swjtu.edu.cn/Userweb/trli30/) and [Yu Zheng](http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng). His main research interests include intelligent urban resource optimization, social networks, spatio-temporal data mining, deep reinforcement learning, etc. He has published ~10 papers on top journals (e.g. PNAS, IEEE TKDE, ACM IMWUT) and top conferences (e.g. WWW, UbiComp). He was a visiting Ph.D. student in Nanyang Technological University and was a research intern in [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) and JD Group.
